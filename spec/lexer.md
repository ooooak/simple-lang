Identifiers: 
  These are names used for variables, functions, arrays, classes, and other user-defined items. They help in identifying a particular memory location.

Example: myVariable, UserClass, print_function
Keywords: Reserved words that have a special meaning in the programming language and cannot be used as identifiers. Keywords are predefined by the language's syntax.

Example: if, else, while, return, class, int, void
Literals: These represent fixed values in the source code that are not altered during the execution of the program. They can be classified into several types, such as:

Integer literals: 123, -456
Floating-point literals: 3.14, -0.001
Character literals: 'a', '1', '\n'
String literals: "Hello, world!", "abc123"
Boolean literals: true, false
Operators: Symbols that specify operations to be performed with operands. Operators can be arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment, and so on.

Example: +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, <=, >=, &&, ||, =
Separators (Delimiters): Characters that separate tokens in the source code. They are used to organize the code structure, such as defining the beginning and end of blocks, separating parameters in method calls, etc.

Example: , (comma), ; (semicolon), { (open brace), } (close brace), ( (open parenthesis), ) (close parenthesis), [ (open bracket), ] (close bracket)
Comments: Although comments are not typically passed to the parser for syntax tree construction, a lexer recognizes them to exclude them from the analysis or to keep them for documentation purposes in some languages. They are not executed and are used to annotate the code.

Example: // single-line comment, /* multi-line comment */
